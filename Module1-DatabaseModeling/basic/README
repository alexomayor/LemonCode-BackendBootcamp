## basic case

![image](./content/screenshot.png)

- I have created 4 main tables

1. home.

- 3 arrays (newCourses, mostViewed and byTopic) which each have embedded id, summary and name of the courses. SUBSET PATTERN applied to newCourses and mostViewed, so the full list of courses is not loaded, improving loading times. Since not many courses will be added daily, the duplicity of this data should not present any serious problem.
<!-- MODELO -->

2. courses.

- title, summary, topic and price added as basic info that will be frequently requested.
- usersRating will be calculated with less frequency, but constantly requested. COMPUTED PATTERN would work best.
- authors: Embedded id and name only, as it is the only data needed in the courses/lessons webpages. The rest of the authors data is included in its separate table, as it will not be consulted as much.

- lessons: All lessons related data has been embedded in this table for quicker access. Videos and articles themselves are not included in this table, only URLs, so the Working Set should not be overloaded.
  -- author id and name has been embbeded. Same goes for topic.
  -- courseLessonsList: Needed to show current course's full list of lessons.

3. user
   All data needed to be shown in user's profile page, from personal information to payment details and purchased/enrolled courses as well as authors followed.
   The rest of the information related to purchases (invoice, amount, payment method used, and other billing data) can be stored in a separate table, which wont be visited as much.

4. authors
   Table used in authors' page. It contains all the information related to the authors.
